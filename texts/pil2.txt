Macmillan HORIZONS Study: Understanding the impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment on everyday life
1. We invite you to take part in a study
* We would like to invite you to take part in the Macmillan HORIZONS study. Before You decide we would like you to understand why the research is being done and what it would involve.
* The research nurse or member of your clinical team will go through the information sheet with you and answer any questions you have. This will take about 10 minutes. Please take the information sheet away with you and you can talk to your friends, family or GP about the study if you wish. Take time to make your decision.
* This study will follow a large group of patients over time who have had a diagnosis of cancer.
We will be asking participants to complete questionnaires to find out how people's health and well-being is after diagnosis and treatment
* We understand that this invitation comes at a time when you have a lot to deal with already, but we need to find out how you are before your treatment, so that we can find out how your health and well-being changes over time.
2. Why are we doing this study?
* A growing number of people are living for many years after cancer treatment but we don't yet know all the ways to support them to ensure the best possible recovery.
* We will be recruiting approximately 3,000 patients over 3 years. Patients will have a diagnosis of either breast cancer who are under 50 years old, gynecological cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Recruitment will take place prior to treatment from hospitals across the UK.
* We are interested in how a diagnosis of cancer and its treatment affects a person's life over time.
* Other studies collect data about people from their medical and hospital records, but we believe it is important to find out about your health and well-being from your perspective through your responses to questionnaires.
* Understanding what is important to people with cancer during their treatment and in the months and years afterwards will help inform support services in the future.
3. Why have I been asked to take part?
* You have been asked to take part in the study because you are awaiting treatment for either breast cancer, gynecological cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
4. What would taking part involve?
* After you have read the information sheet and have had your questions answered, you will be asked whether you are happy to take part in the study.
* If you would like to take part you will be given a consent form to complete with the nurse or researcher and a questionnaire to fill in. You can complete the questionnaire during your hospital visit and hand it to the nurse or researcher or you can take it home to complete and return in the pre-paid envelope.
* You will be asked to fill in questionnaires before your treatment starts and then again in 3 months, 12 months, 18 months and 2 years. After that point, you will be sent a questionnaire once a year.
* You can complete the study questionnaires on paper or online. The first questionnaire will be completed on paper, at the end you can choose to complete the next questionnaires on paper or online. If you choose paper, these will be posted to your home address. If you prefer to complete them online, the details of how to do this will be either posted or emailed to you. Pre-paid envelopes will be provided for return of paper questionnaires.
* If we do not receive your completed questionnaires within two weeks we will contact you to remind you. If we have not received your questionnaire after another two weeks, we will send you a new one.
* We would also like to ask your permission to gather information that is routinely collected about you by the NHS, such as your clinical and treatment details both through your medical records and national databases such as NHS Digital and other central UK bodies.
* You do not have to take part in this study and your clinical care will not be affected by your decision. If you decide to take part but change your mind in the future you can withdraw at any time.
5. What are the possible benefits of taking part?
* We cannot promise that taking part in this study will help you personally. Some patients may find it helpful to think about issues related to their cancer. We hope that the information you provide in your questionnaires will help us understand peopleâ€™s experiences following diagnosis and treatment for cancer.
6. What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?
* We do not anticipate that there will be any risks to you in taking part in the study, but if you have any concerns about your health as a result you should contact your doctor or nurse.
* Sometimes people find it difficult to talk or write about their experiences. We will be asking you about your emotional health, for example, how you are coping. You do not have to answer any questions that you do not want to.
* If you have not returned the first questionnaire two weeks after you have consented, we may ring you to see if you have any questions regarding the study or require another questionnaire.
* If you return a questionnaire with missing information, we will contact you just to check if this information has been missed by accident or not. We will only ask you for information that you are happy to give us.
* If you are finding any aspect of your experience difficult, we can also provide you with details of where you might get more support. For example: Maggieâ€™s Centres (www.maggiescentres.org) or Macmillan Cancer Support (www.macmillan.org.uk). You may also want to talk to your GP or hospital clinical team if you have more specific questions.
