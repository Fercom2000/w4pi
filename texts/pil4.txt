TrueNTH Global Registry Participant Information Sheet
1. We invite you to take part in a study
*We would like to invite you to take part in the TrueNTH Global Registry Study. Before you decide we would like you to understand why the research is being done and what it would involve.
*The research nurse or member of your clinical team will go through the information sheet with you and answer any questions you have. This will take about 10 minutes. Please take the information sheet away with you and you can talk to your friends, family or clinical team about the study if you wish. Take time to make your decision.
*This study will follow a large group of patients, both from the UK and around the world, over time who have had a diagnosis of prostate cancer. We will be asking participants to complete questionnaires to find out how men’s health and well-being is after diagnosis and treatment.
*We understand that this invitation comes at a time when you have a lot to deal with already, but we need to find out how you are before your treatment, so that we can find out whether your health and well-being changes over time.
2. Why are we doing this study?
*The care for men with prostate cancer varies greatly around the world.
*We will be asking approximately 1,300 patients from the UK to take part in the study over 3 years. Patients will have had a diagnosis of localised prostate cancer (cancer is confined to the prostate and hasn’t spread anywhere else in the body). Recruitment will take place prior to treatment from hospitals across the UK.
*We are interested in how a diagnosis of prostate cancer and its treatment affects a person’s health and wellbeing.
*Other studies collect data about people from their medical and hospital records, but we believe it is important to find out about your health and wellbeing from your perspective through your responses to questionnaires.
*Comparing data from the UK and around the world will help us to understand new ways to improve care for men with prostate cancer.
3. Why have I been asked to take part?
*You have been asked to take part in the study because you have been diagnosed with localised prostate cancer and are waiting for treatment or are undergoing watchful waiting or active surveillance.
4. What would taking part involve?
*After you have read the information sheet and have had your questions answered, you will be asked whether you are happy to take part in the study.
*If you would like to take part you will be given a consent form to complete with the nurse or researcher and a questionnaire to fill in. You can complete the questionnaire electronically or on paper during your hospital visit and hand it to the nurse or researcher or you can take it home to complete and return in the pre-paid envelope.
*You will be asked to fill in questionnaires before your treatment starts and then again 12 months after the start of your treatment.
*You may receive the first questionnaire by post, in person during a clinic appointment, or be provided with details on how to complete the questionnaire electronically. The next questionnaire will be posted to your home address or emailed to you depending on your preference. Pre-paid envelopes will be provided for return of paper questionnaires.
*If we do not receive your completed questionnaires within two weeks we will contact you to remind you. If we have not received your questionnaire after another two weeks, we will send you a new one.
*We are also gathering information for the TrueNTH Global Registry project that is routinely collected by the NHS, such as clinical and treatment details both through medical records and national databases such as the Health and Social Care Information Centre and other central UK bodies.
*If you would not like your clinical information to be included please sign an opt-out form and return it using a pre-paid envelope to your hospital.
*You do not have to take part in this study and your clinical care will not be affected by your decision. If you decide to take part but change your mind in the future you can withdraw at any time.
5. What are the possible benefits of taking part?
*We cannot say that taking part in this study will help you personally. Although some patients may find it helpful to think about issues related to their cancer.
*Findings during the study will be reported back to participating NHS hospitals leading to possible improvements in the care you receive. The study may also benefit prostate cancer patients in the future.
*We hope that the information you provide in your questionnaires will help us understand men’s health and wellbeing following diagnosis of localised prostate cancer.
6. What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?
*We do not anticipate that there will be any risks to you in taking part in the study, but if you have any concerns about your health as a result you should contact your doctor or nurse.
*Sometimes people find it difficult to talk or write about their experiences. We will be asking you about your health, for example, sexual function. You do not have to answer any questions that you do not want to.
*If you return a questionnaire with missing information, we may contact you just to check if this information has been missed by accident or not. We will only ask you for information that you are happy to give us.
*If you are finding any aspect of your experience difficult, we can also provide you with details of where you might get more support. For example: Prostate Cancer UK (www.prostatecanceruk.org), Maggie’s Centres (www.maggiescentres.org) or Macmillan Cancer Support (www.macmillan.org.uk). You may also want to talk to your GP or hospital clinical team if you have more specific questions.
