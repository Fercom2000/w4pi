7;"1";"flupoc";"You are being invited to take part in the research study named above. Before you decide if you want to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Please see the flowchart at the end which details what it means for you to take part. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. Thank you for reading this information sheet.";"AlignTab";7
8;"1";"flupoc";"What is the purpose of this study?";"s";8
9;"1";"flupoc";"Infection by respiratory viruses, including influenza (`flu`), can lead to serious illnesses, such as pneumonia, asthma exacerbation or COPD exacerbation that require people to be admitted to hospital. Current methods of detection of these viruses can take several days for the results to become available to the doctors looking after patients. If these tests are positive for respiratory viruses it may alter which treatments are offered (such as antibiotics or antiviral medication for influenza), or the place in which that the patient is cared for (such as a side room).";"AlignTab";9
10;"1";"flupoc";"Rapid `point-of-care` tests for respiratory viruses have been developed and can provide accurate results in 1 hour rather than several days. We wish to explore if this test improves care for patients with influenza. If you join this study then you may either have the rapid test or standard NHS care, and this is decided randomly by a computer. More information is provided overleaf.";"AlignTab";10
11;"1";"flupoc";"Why have I been asked?";"s";11
12;"1";"flupoc";"The symptoms and clinical signs that you display are consistent with an `acute respiratory illness` and so we would like to test you for a wide variety of respiratory viruses (including influenza), which might have caused your illness, using a rapid point-of-care test. We would then collect data from your hospital case notes to see if testing you with this method made any difference to your care and how quickly you recovered.";"AlignTab";12
13;"1";"flupoc";"We are therefore asking for volunteers over the age of 18 who present to hospital with an acute respiratory illness to be part of this study";"AlignTab";13
14;"1";"flupoc";"Do I have to take part?";"s";14
15;"1";"flupoc";"No, it is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form. If you decide to take part, you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. A decision to withdraw at any time, or a decision not to take part, will not affect the standard of care you receive.";"AlignTab";15
16;"1";"flupoc";"What will happen to me if I take part?";"s";16
17;"1";"flupoc";"After you have finishing reading this, you will have the opportunity to discuss the study in more detail with a member of the research team. If you are happy to take part, then you will be asked to read and sign a consent form. A computer program will then assign you randomly to one of two groups (A and B). Group allocation is completely random: neither the research team nor anyone else can influence which group you are placed into. Both groups will have a swab taken from the nose and throat but only group A will have the swab tested immediately on the point-of-care test machine. We will also ask all patients to have a blood test taken (about a tablespoon full) although you have the right to decline this, should you wish.";"AlignTab";17
18;"1";"flupoc";"The swab (which is like a `cotton bud`) is briefly put up your nose and in the back of your throat. If you are able to cough up sputum then we will also ask for a sample of this too, to be tested at the same time.";"AlignTab";18
19;"1";"flupoc";"If you are in Group A your samples will be analysed for many different viruses using the rapid test which takes about 1 hour. You will then be informed of the results, as will the doctors and nurses looking after you. You still have the right to discuss the results with the research team and the clinical team looking after you. If you have a swab that reveals that you have a virus, we may approach you again to ask if you would give us permission to take further nasal swabs, sputum (if you are coughing up sputum) and another blood test (about half a tablespoon full) for additional ethically approved research. If your test shows you have influenza you will be offered anti-influenza treatment according to national guidelines.";"AlignTab";19
20;"1";"flupoc";"If you are in Group B you will be managed according to standard care. The clinical team looking after you may wish to test you for respiratory viruses and if they do, this will be using standard laboratory testing. We may approach you again to ask if you would give us permission to take further nasal swabs, sputum (if you are coughing up sputum) and another blood test (about half a tablespoon full) for additional ethically approved research.";"AlignTab";20
21;"1";"flupoc";"For both Groups A and B you have the right to decline all or any of these further research samples, should you wish, and this will not affect you being part of this study or the care you receive. If you lose the ability to consent and the research team wish to take any more samples from you, then we would have to get written permission from someone close to you, and you would have to agree that we could use them once you recovered.";"AlignTab";21
22;"1";"flupoc";"Once you have been discharged a researcher will look at your hospital case notes to determine if having the test performed, or not has affected your management during your hospital stay. This includes how quickly you were discharged, whether you were nursed in a side room and decisions relating to antibiotic or antiviral medication.";"AlignTab";22
23;"1";"flupoc";"What about confidentiality?";"s";23
24;"1";"flupoc";"We take participant confidentiality very seriously. Only a very limited amount of personal identifiable information is requested from you, and when we come to look at and publish any results then information is presented anonymously ` i.e. your details and personal information are never made available.";"AlignTab";24
25;"1";"flupoc";"Your GP would be informed that you are participating in this study.";"AlignTab";25
26;"1";"flupoc";"The doctors and nurses treating you are told the results of the point-of-care test looking for respiratory viruses for those in Group A.";"AlignTab";26
27;"1";"flupoc";"What are the risks?";"s";27
28;"1";"flupoc";"The risks of having a simple swab taken from your nose and throat in this study are minimal but it can be mildly uncomfortable for some people. The blood tests are not risky but may also be mildly uncomfortable and sometimes leave a bruise. Study activities are insured via the hospital and University of Southampton.";"AlignTab";28
29;"1";"flupoc";"What are the benefits?";"s";29
30;"1";"flupoc";"Those in Group A, who have the rapid point-of-care test, might have a quicker diagnosis and treatment, but we cannot be sure. All participants may feel that they are bringing benefit to sick patients in the future by being part of this research.";"AlignTab";30
31;"1";"flupoc";"What happens when the research study stops?";"s";31
32;"1";"flupoc";"Once the study finishes the data collected will be analysed by a statistician to see what difference the test made to clinical care of patients with influenza. The samples collected during the study are stored without any of personal details on them and are only used in further ethically approved research under the direction of the chief investigator of this study.";"AlignTab";32
33;"1";"flupoc";"What will happen to the results of the research study?";"s";33
34;"1";"flupoc";"We intend to publish the results of our research in medical journals and to present the results at scientific meetings. The information from these journals is available on the internet. All results are anonymous in these publications or presentations. We would like any useful results to form the basis of other studies looking at this and also change how medical professionals treat patients for the better.";"AlignTab";34
35;"1";"flupoc";"Who is organising and funding this research?";"s";35
36;"1";"flupoc";"The UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) is funding this research. The makers of the machines used to test for respiratory viruses are not sponsoring this study and the researchers are not funded or rewarded by the manufacturers. The NHS research and university authorities may examine the data we have collected from you to ensure it is accurate.";"AlignTab";36
37;"1";"flupoc";"Who has approved this study?";"s";37
38;"1";"flupoc";"An ethics committee has reviewed the design of this study and approved it to go ahead. The UK Heath Research Authority and the local NHS Research and Development department have approved this study too.";"AlignTab";38
39;"1";"flupoc";"Who can I talk to further?";"s";39
40;"1";"flupoc";"The research team are very happy to answer your questions and discuss things further with you. You are welcome to talk to your doctors and nurses, family and friends, should you wish, about participating. Should you have any specific concerns you are welcome to discuss these with a research doctor, or the chief investigator, or Patient Support Services, about how you might take your concerns further.";"AlignTab";40

161;"3";"null";"The Charity Prostate Cancer UK in conjunction with Movember is funding the introduction of a new service - the Prostate Cancer Survivorship Care Programme - in five NHS hospitals in the UK. The Care Programme will be introduced in January 2015. Part of the Care Programme will be a workshop for men with prostate cancer which will help them better manage any prostate cancer related issues they have. The workshop has been used previously with patients with breast, colorectal and testicular cancer. The content of the workshop has been adapted to suit the needs of men with prostate cancer. We want to find out what men think about the workshop and whether it might be improved.";"AlignTab";8

We will not be able to talk to everyone but would like to talk to men of different ages, who have had different cancer treatments and different levels of experience of computing. Interviews will be audio recorded so that we can analyse them later. The interview will not take more than 60 minutes. There are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers, we are interested in your opinions and experiences. The interview can be held at the hospital, a university office or at your home, whichever you prefer, and at a time convenient to you. Your responses will be anonymous and you will not be identifiable from any of the recordings or reports arising from the study.";"AlignTab";15
