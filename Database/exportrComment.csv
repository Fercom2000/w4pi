After you have finishing reading this, you will have the opportunity to discuss the study in more detail with a member of the research team. If you are happy to take part, then you will be asked to read and sign a consent form. A computer program will then assign you randomly to one of two groups (A and B). Group allocation is completely random: neither the research team nor anyone else can influence which group you are placed into. Both groups will have a swab taken from the nose and throat but only group A will have the swab tested immediately on the point-of-care test machine. We will also ask all patients to have a blood test taken (about a tablespoon full) although you have the right to decline this, should you wish.
The swab (which is like a `cotton bud`) is briefly put up your nose and in the back of your throat. If you are able to cough up sputum then we will also ask for a sample of this too, to be tested at the same time.
If you are in Group A your samples will be analysed for many different viruses using the rapid test which takes about 1 hour. You will then be informed of the results, as will the doctors and nurses looking after you. You still have the right to discuss the results with the research team and the clinical team looking after you. If you have a swab that reveals that you have a virus, we may approach you again to ask if you would give us permission to take further nasal swabs, sputum (if you are coughing up sputum) and another blood test (about half a tablespoon full) for additional ethically approved research. If your test shows you have influenza you will be offered anti-influenza treatment according to national guidelines.
If you are in Group B you will be managed according to standard care. The clinical team looking after you may wish to test you for respiratory viruses and if they do, this will be using standard laboratory testing. We may approach you again to ask if you would give us permission to take further nasal swabs, sputum (if you are coughing up sputum) and another blood test (about half a tablespoon full) for additional ethically approved research.
For both Groups A and B you have the right to decline all or any of these further research samples, should you wish, and this will not affect you being part of this study or the care you receive. If you lose the ability to consent and the research team wish to take any more samples from you, then we would have to get written permission from someone close to you, and you would have to agree that we could use them once you recovered.
Once you have been discharged a researcher will look at your hospital case notes to determine if having the test performed, or not has affected your management during your hospital stay. This includes how quickly you were discharged, whether you were nursed in a side room and decisions relating to antibiotic or antiviral medication.","What will happen to me if I take part?

The questionnaire will include questions about what you liked and didn't like about the workshop format and content. The questionnaire can be completed at the end of the workshop session, or at home and returned to us in a freepost envelope which we will provide.
You will also be asked whether you are happy to take part in an interview about your experience of the workshop. We will not be able to talk to everyone but would like to talk to men of different ages, who have had different cancer treatments and different levels of experience of computing. Interviews will be audio recorded so that we can analyse them later. The interview will not take more than 60 minutes. There are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers, we are interested in your opinions and experiences. The interview can be held at the hospital, a university office or at your home, whichever you prefer, and at a time convenient to you.
