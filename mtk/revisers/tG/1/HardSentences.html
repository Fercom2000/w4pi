* If you return a questionnaire with missing information, we will contact you just to check if this information has been missed by accident or not.
* This information will not identify you and will not be combined with other information in a way that could identify you.

We will not be able to talk to everyone but would like to talk to men of different ages, who have had different cancer treatments and different levels of experience of computing.
The research is being organised and co-ordinated by the University of Southampton in conjuction with the University of Surrey.
The interview can be held at the hospital, a university office or at your home, whichever you prefer, and at a time convenient to you.
If, having read this information, you are happy to take part, please complete the questionnaire and return it to the researcher at the workshop, or send it to us at the University of Southampton in the pre-paid envelope provided.

Patients will have had a diagnosis of localised prostate cancer (cancer is confined to the prostate and hasnâ€™t spread anywhere else in the body).
*We understand that this invitation comes at a time when you have a lot to deal with already, but we need to find out how you are before your treatment, so that we can find out whether your health and well-being changes over time.
Please take the information sheet away with you and you can talk to your friends, family or clinical team about the study if you wish.
